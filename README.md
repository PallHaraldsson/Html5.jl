# Html5

# Generates HTML tag strings for HTML5 elements included in Mozilla's documentation of HTML5. 
Attributes are passed as parameters. If the attribute name is a reserved word, the attribute is suffixed with "_attr" (ex: for_attr).
To declare a DOCTYPE, wrap html() with function html_doc().
Mozilla's documentation for HTML5 is available here: <https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Web/HTML/Element>.
Elements marked by Mozilla as obsolete around 1/24/2021 were not included.
